# hello-world
Hello!  My name is David and I am just getting started out on GitHub!  I am a blank book ready to be filled with knowledge.

I was born and raised in VA.  I went to Radford University, did not graduate, school was not for me at the time.  I then became a leasing agent for over a year and decided that customer service was not for me.  I have always had a love for computers and I'd rather deal with a computer all day than lease apartments.  I also DJ and produce music in my spare time.  I mostly mix/produce house and techno music but I do love trap and dubstep as well.  That should be good for meow.
