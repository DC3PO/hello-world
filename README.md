# hello-world
Hello!  My name is David and I am a web developer and designer!

I was born and raised in VA.  I went to Radford University, did not graduate but got my IT certification from the University of Virginia.  I have been designing and developing websites for the past 4 years and have loved every minute of it.  HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js are just some of the tools of the trade I use.  I am also a DJ and producer and love to go on hikes and be outside as much as I can.
